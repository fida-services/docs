# Policy Discovery

Every policy within the Fida ecosystem is discoverable. This discovery process is facilitated during Fida policy creation by minting a beacon token. This token enables the straightforward discovery of all Fida policy contracts on the blockchain. The beacon token is associated with a distinct currency symbol, known as the Fida System Id. We acknowledge the possibility of multiple Fida Systems operating simultaneously on a blockchain.
