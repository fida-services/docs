# Issuing Policy

The Policy contract will be deployed on `Layer 1` (the base network). Initially, we plan to develop software in the form of a `cli` (command-line interface) comprising two parts: an `on-chain` component written in `Haskell` and an `off-chain` component written in `Purescript`. Later, the off-chain part will be adapted and integrated with a web application, enabling all transactions to be conducted through a web browser with support from several web wallets available on the market.

In the process of issuing a Fida Policy, there are three main actors involved: the policy broker, the policy owner (buyer), and the investors (who provide collateral for the policy). The policy broker, possessing special permissions, can, for instance, trigger state transitions of the policy or mark it as discoverable on the chain. All actors, when using the `cli`, are required to provide access to their wallets in the form of script input parameters. The `cli` is capable of crafting a transaction, signing it using the provided key, and sending it to the chain.

The process of issuing a policy with the assistance of the provided `cli` could proceed as follows: Clients initially approach the policy broker with the intention of purchasing a policy. They provide input parameters such as an insurance amount (which the broker translates into collateral amount), wallet public key hash, contract duration, and so forth. Subsequently, they must agree on the cost the client must pay for the policy. Once agreed upon, the policy broker, using the `cli`, creates a policy and provides an address (Fida Policy Contract Address) where the client must send the agreed amount (premium amount). Upon receiving the payment at the correct address, the broker triggers a state transition of the policy contract, thereby making the client the policy owner, and the policy becomes available for the funding phase.

Investors, utilizing the `cli`, can search the blockchain for a Fida Policy available for funding and contribute to the funding by purchasing a Fida Card Policy through the issuance of an appropriate transaction. On the other hand, the policy owner can monitor the progress of the funding phase using the `cli` by querying the blockchain for specific policy information or obtaining a list of all policies in which they are the owner. Once the policy is fully funded, the policy broker, upon contacting the client, triggers a Fida Policy state transition, and the policy becomes "on risk" from that point onward.
