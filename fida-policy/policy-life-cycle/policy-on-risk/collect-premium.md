# Collect Premium

Every month, investors have the opportunity to collect a portion of the premium deposited within the policy script. This amount is directly correlated to the shares they possess. Investors are not obligated to claim the premium frequently, as it accumulates over each payment interval and can be collected even after the policy expires. To collect the premium, investors must possess a Fida cards token within their investor script.
