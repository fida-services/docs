# Claim a Claim

Only the policy owner has the authority to collect a claim. Before the claim can be collected, it must be prepared and authorized in accordance with the respective policy authority. The authorization process entails the creation of an authorization transaction signed according to the policy authority's requirements. The policy authority refers to the entity or entities responsible for making decisions regarding the policy. Various options are available, such as:

* SingleSign: A single signature is required from a specified wallet.
* AtLeastOneSign: At least one signature is required from a designated list of wallets.
* AllMustSign: Signatures from all wallets on the list are necessary.
