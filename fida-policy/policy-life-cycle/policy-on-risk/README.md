# Policy on Risk

The policy's on-risk status is the most interesting stage in its lifecycle, most events are actionable when the policy is in this state. Being on-risk implies that, in the event of a claim, the policy owner can initiate a claim, which can initially be covered by either the investors' premium pools or the policy's collateral. The policy remains on-risk until it expires, is canceled, or a full claim is made. During the on-risk phase, investors receive a portion of the premium on a monthly basis, determined by their respective share levels.
