# Policy Funding

Policy funding occurs after the policy is created and continues until all share units are sold.&#x20;

It is permissible to cancel a policy without incurring any adverse consequences; in such an event, all collateral will be refunded to the investors, and the policy owner will not be charged for the cancellation.
