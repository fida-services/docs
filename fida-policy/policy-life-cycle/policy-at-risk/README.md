# Policy at Risk

The policy's at-risk status is the most interesting stage in its lifecycle, where numerous events can influence its state. Being at risk implies that, in the event of a claim, the policy owner can initiate a claim, which can initially be covered by either the investors' premium pools or the policy's collateral. The policy remains at risk until it expires, is canceled, or a full claim is made. During the at-risk phase, investors receive a portion of the premium on a monthly basis, determined by their respective share levels.
