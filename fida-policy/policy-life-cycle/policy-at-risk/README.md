# Policy at Risk

The policy's on-risk status is the most interesting stage in its lifecycle, where numerous events can influence its state. Being at risk implies that, in the event of a claim, the policy owner can initiate a claim, which can initially be covered by either the investors' premium pools or the policy's collateral. The policy remains at risk until it expires, is canceled, or a claim is made. During the on-risk phase, the policy owner is required to pay the premium each month, and this premium is distributed among all investors based on their share levels.
