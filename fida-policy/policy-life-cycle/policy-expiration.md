# Policy Expiration

The policy expires once all payment intervals have elapsed. At this point, the collateral associated with the policy, deposited in the investor script, will be unlocked and merged into the investor's premium pool. The premium amount deposited in the policy script can then be entirely collected by the respective investor.
