# Transform Risk into Opportunity!

The Fida Risk Transfer Protocol decentralizes risk. In so doing, it makes insurance liquid, safe, and efficient for everyone. Users receive coverage on submitted policies, earn premiums from policy payments and collect fees of protocol usage.

Our mission is to close the coverage gap, protecting those who would before not have access to insurance by unlocking a new insurance infrastructure within the web3 revolution.

These pages document how we've structured the protocol and provide the resources necessary to fully understand how the protocol is able to transfer risk, improve investment liquidity, and allow regulators transparent access to the health and stability of on-chain insurance portfolios.&#x20;

Please join the [Fida Community Discord server](https://discord.gg/jjwnEKh8) to connect with the Fida Finance Core Team. We look forward to answering any of your questions and helping you integrate with and build on top of the Fida Risk Transfer Protocol.

It's time to forget risk as we've known it.
