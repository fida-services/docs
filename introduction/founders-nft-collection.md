# ðŸŽ´ Founder's NFT Collection

## Benefits of the Fida Founders NFT Collection

The Fida Founders NFT Collection offers a range of exclusive benefits that set it apart from other NFT collections. This collection is not just about digital art, or the historic introduction of global decentralized insurance. but a utility token within the Fida ecosystem. Here are the benefits we're currently planning for the token:

## For Everyone:

### **Early Access to the Fida System**

As a holder of the Fida Founders NFT, you will be invited to the private testnet. This early access allows you to familiarize yourself with the platform, navigate its features, and most importantly influence its development through feature requests and user experience suggestions.

All Fida Founder Cards grant owners Early Access to features within the Fida System.

### Boosted Staking

The $fida token will be used as the security and trust mechanism for the decentralized operation of the network and the Founder's Collection cards all offer their owner's Boosted Staking rights, multiplying their effective staked amount in how they are securing the system. The boosted staking amount goes from 2% to 12% (Zevon)

### Node Operators

As fida continues to decentralize, the operation of Fida nodes will be fully decentralized and 100 Fida Founder Card holders will be able to setup and run&#x20;
