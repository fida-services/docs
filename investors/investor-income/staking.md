# Staking

Investors have the opportunity to earn by staking the Ada collected in their investor script, which includes both the premium pool and locked collateral. However, the investor must consent to staking. If they choose to stake, they must execute a transaction to register stake credentials and select the stake pool to delegate the deposited Ada in their investor script. This procedure also entails paying a collateral fee, which can be recovered if the investor changes their mind.
