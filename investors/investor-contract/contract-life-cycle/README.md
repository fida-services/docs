# Contract Life Cycle

Through the investor contract, investors can undertake actions that impact Fida policies and the state of their investor contract. Registration in the system is the initial step for investors, granting access to the complete portfolio of the Fida Ecosystem. Subsequently, investors can engage in various activities such as buying or selling Fida cards, earning and collecting premiums, withdrawing premiums to their wallet, and ultimately closing their account to reclaim the collateral paid during registration.
