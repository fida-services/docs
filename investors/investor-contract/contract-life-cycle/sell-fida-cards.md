# Sell Fida Cards

Each Fida Card owned by an investor can be sold in third-party markets. The initial step is to claim the owned Fida Card. This process involves depositing collateral, reflecting the specific Fida Card, into the related Fida Policy and transferring the Fida Card to the investor's wallet. Subsequently, the investor can sell the card on any third-party marketplace at a price of their choosing.&#x20;

It is the responsibility of the Fida Card buyer to verify the actual price, and we offer a dedicated endpoint to retrieve the real price for a given Fida Card.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a Fida card is withdrawn (moved outside the Fida System), the investor is unable to collect premiums.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The first action required of the buyer of a Fida Card is to return the Fida Card to the system by redeeming it. In this scenario, the Fida Card is deposited into the investor script, and the related collateral is transferred to the investor script. From then on, the investor can collect the premium associated with this Fida Card.
