# Buy Fida Cards

After registration, investors can engage in the funding phase of a policy by purchasing Fida cards, which represent shares in the collateral amount of the policy. Investors can buy Fida cards using their own resources in their wallet or utilize the funds accumulated in their investor scripts from the premium pool.

Investors can also buy Fida Cards for Policies that are already on-risk. This is done through secondary markets, and requires investors to deposit their newly purchased into their investor portfolio.
